Recall:
We said A is invertible <=> there exists A', a 2-sided inverse.
i.e., such that...
AA' = In, A' is a right inverse.
A'A = In, A' is a left inverse.

# A matrix is called "singular" if it is not invertible. In contrast,
  an invertible matrix is referred as being "non-singular".

# Matrix partitioning
  * Row / Column slices through a large matrix to make multiple
    smaller matrices to create a new matrix build using the smaller
    variable defined matrix.

  [  1  2 |  0  1  0 |  0 ]  
  [-----------------------]  = [ A11 A12 A13 ]
  [  0  6 | -3 -3  1 |  0 ]  = [ A21 A22 A23 ]
  [  0  6 |  6  3  0 |  1 ]

  This turns the original matrix into a block matrix.
  
  * Blocks that are cut similarly can fulfill mathematical operations such
    as addition. If the slices are not similar then no equivilancy exists
    and operations are undefined.
