Defining Artifical Intelligence
-------------------------------
* Artificial intelligence is the science of making machines that think like humans.

  Difficulty - Human brains are difficult to reverse engineer, enters the realm of cognitive/neuro science
               more than it does AI.

* Making machines which 'act' human.
    The Turing Test
      - Machine are too optimized and need to be 'humanized' by making them faliable and slowing them down.
      - Examples (Google Chatbot, Princeton AI)

* Alternative approach
  Rather than developing machines that think like humans, why not develop machines that think rationally?
    - Syllogism: A rational/logical approach to understanding human thinking that propose concrete arguments and
                 a finite rule set.

* Thinking vs. Acting
  Rational Action is an approach which abandons the approach of human understanding as a process of thoughts and 
  views it as a series of actions and reflexes. The process of doing.

  The benefit of this approach is it generalizes our understanding of humanity and allows for an imperfect design.

What have we learned from human intelligence?
  * Learning from the past
  * Simulating the future (planning)
      Action - Result - Decision
  * Machine learning 

Applications
  - Fun, entertainment
  
Historical Aspects

Intelligent Agent
-----------------
* An agent is an entity that perceives its environment through sensors and acts upon its environment through atuators.
