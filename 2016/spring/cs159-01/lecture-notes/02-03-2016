Evolution of Computer Architecture
 - The Computer Hardware "Evolution Highway"
   - Hardware & Software (Car & Driver)

 * Microscopic POV
-----------------------
   -Intel 8086
    Introduced 1978
    29,000 Transistors
    5 MGz Clock Frequency

    -Intel Core2 Duo
    ...

    We can see within 28 years that the number of transistors have increased by 10,034X
    Clock Frequency increased by 586X
 
    * The primary driver for this observation.
      - Moore's Law
      - According to his observation that computing power doubles q18-q24 months we can plot
        the historic trends and see that his observations were correct.

    * Historically, performance gains have evolved from clock frequency increases.
      Unfortunately we have reached the limitations of clock-rates.
      - The reason for this barrier is due to a heat and power wall. Power and Heat grows as Frequency^3
        CMOS (Complementary Metal-oxide Semiconductor)

    * To bypass the power/heat wall, the engineering of single-core processing has been abandoned
      for multi-core processing. Sequential processing must be traded-in for parallel processing.

    * Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP)
      - Pipelining (Microscopic)
      - Multi-Function Units (Macroscopic)
    
      ILP parallel processing on the hardware level but unfrotunately has over time also 
      suffered from diminishing returns. This has led for a greater push for software
      driven solutions.

    * Moore's Law still continues to persist but rather than increasing clock-frequency,
      multiple cores are being utilized to achieve performance gains.

  - Macroscopic POV
-------------------
    * Node: Single computer.
    * Cluster Computer: Combines processing power of 100's of nodes. Exists in generally a close proximity.
    * Grid Computer: 1,000's of nodes, essentially clusters of clusters distributed over a wide area to once again
                      combine computing power.
    * Cloud Computer: 10,000's nodes, highly distributed (global scale).

Hardware Solution - Business

Computer processing power has a highly elastic supply and demand curve.
  (This is a phenomenom unique to computing)

  * Increased supply generates an increased demand

    ...-->Hardware-->Software-->Software-->...

  * Software will always manage to push the limits of hardware.
  
  - From a business POV, we want to operate at an optimal point on the *cost per performance as a function of performance* curve.

                            Cost/Performance
                                  vs.
                             Performance

                              \         /
        Under-utilization -->  \       / <-- Over-utilization
                                \     /
                                 -----
                                   ^
                                   |
                            Optimum-utilization

Under:
Optimum:
Over: Pushing performance beyond it designed capabilities.

  * Pushing the hardware performance capabilities has a higher cost than simply using
    software to achieve the same end goal. From a business point of view, parallel 
    processing is clearly the better option.
