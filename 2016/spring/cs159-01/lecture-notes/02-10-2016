Key Points - Software Challenge

Parallel Programming is Hard!
  - Complex
  - Lack of Tools
  - New types of bugs
    - Race conditions
    - Deadlocks
  - Harder to debug, test, debug, scale

Opportunities
-------------

* Technical
Opportunity to create new sw engineering infrastructure
  - design/redesign
  - debugging
  - testing
  - profiling

opportunity to re-invent entire sw engineering field
  - a second chance to get it right

The universe is inherently parallel
  - weather
  - galaxy formation
  - epidemics
  - traffic patterns

we can leverage unique capabilities offered by parallelism
we can add new features via separate parallel modules
  - avoid re-engineering old modules (re-engineering would likely introduce new bugs!)
    - instead introduce a new module on a second threat so we don't risk side-effects
  - add more functionality
  - avoid increasing in wall processing time

speculative computation
  - precompute alternatives to minimize response time
    - this would lead to responsive user interfaces
 
(yet) undiscovered technical opportunities
  - new parallel algorithms
  - super-linear speedups 
    * parallel computer has n times more memory
    * larger % of sw can fit in upper levels of memory hierarchy
    * existing algorithms could run faster

cloud and parallel processing makes high-performance computing (hpc) ubiquitous
  - new applications become possible
    * genetic & molecular profiling
    * real-time analytics

  - smarter applications become possible
    * virtual assistants
 
  - efficiency becomes possible
    * high-fidelity simulations

with high performance computer, grand challeneges become possible
  * A grand challenge:
    - fundamental problem in science or engineeringi
    - has potentially broad economic and scientific impact
    - could be advanced with hpc resources

  * ex
    - data mining / fusion
    - hurricane prediction
    - global warming
    - world hunger
    - cure for serious disease 

business opportunities
----------------------
assist in the interpretation of massive data sets
  - ex - a 5-day weather forecast would potentially produce 10 terabytes of data
  * humans are very good at detecting and interpreting high level visual patterns
    even better than a computer can today
