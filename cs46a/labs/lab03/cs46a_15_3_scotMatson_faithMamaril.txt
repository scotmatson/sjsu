  Part A:
    01. Done.
    02. Done.
    03. Done.
    04. Done.
    05. No, the Robot exists but it has not been drawn on the Canvas.
    06. We added a .draw() method to our object which draws the image to the
        canvas.
    07. Done.
    08. The Robot graphic moves right.

  Part B:
    01. Done.
    02. Instantiating a Robot and running the moveDown() method.
    03. Done.
    04. Done.
    05. The robot moves to the right and up.
    06. The robot goes off of the screen.
    07. Done.
    08. He moves to the bottom right corner.
    09. By taking the opposite sign of the original values.

  Part C:
    01. An accessor, because it returns a value and does not change any values.
    02. The current x value.
    03. We are returned the original value, nothing has changed.
    04. Done.
    05. From our Robots location we received 7 as our x position.
    06. The moveRight() method.
    07. Done.
    08. By printing the values returned.

  Part D:
    01. Done.
    02. A new robot object is constructed and the robot is 'animated' to a new
        position, starting in the upper left corner and ending in the lower
        right corner of the canvas.
    03. Done.
    04. The first robot appears and moves to his new location. The new robot
        appears but moves vertically off of the canvas out of view.
    05. No they are not. The aspect ratios are thrown off.
    06. By dividing pic.getX() by pic.getWidth().
    07. The aspect ratio is now correct and the robot is repositioned as
        expected.
    08. Done.
    09. No, our getX and getY methods are indepedent of the X and Y instance
        variables. We can remove the safely.
    10. Comment out all statements which use the x and y instance variables,
        run our tester program. We should still receive the expected output.
    11. As expected, nothing has changed.

  Part E:
    01. We could have just used moveHortizontally(1) instead of using moveRight().
    02. By referencing the class name first and then the object name.
    03. Done.
    04. By running my tester class.
    05. Done.
    06. By using 'this' or the class name.
    07. Yes, the test case still passes.
    08. I prefer using 'this'. It is what I was taught first and to me is more
        readable.
    09. Done.
    10. Done.
