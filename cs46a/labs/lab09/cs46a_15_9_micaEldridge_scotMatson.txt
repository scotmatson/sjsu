Section 15, Lab 9

A.
  #1 a, b, c, & e.
  #2 done.
  #3 Iterate through each letter of our word.
     If the letter is a vowel append it to our String.
  #4 Done.
  #5 Done.

B.
  #1 Done. We iterated through the String twice.
  #2 Iterate through the word again.
     If the letter is not a vowel append it to our String.
  #3 Make two Strings, one to capture the vowel and one to capture the non-vowel.
     After the loop ends append the non-vowel String to the end of the vowel String.

C.
  #1 The vowels.
     The non-vowels.
     result += getNonVowels()
  #2 The get getNonVowels method.
  #3 getNonVowels()
  #4 Looping through the string, if the letter at the current index is not a vowel
     it will be appended to a storage string. Upon completion of the loop the storage
     string will be returned.
  #5 Done.

D.
  #1 Done.
  #2 At the beginning.
     To a temp String memory location.
     And the end of the String.
  #3 if letter is a vowel
     append it to our string instead of counting it
     when we've found a nonVowel we will print the current vowel group
  #4 newVowelGroup = nextVowelGroup
     if newVowelGroup > largestVowelGroupSoFar
     largestVowelGroupSoFar= newVowelGroup
  #5 newVowelGroup = nextVowelGroup
     if newVowelGroup > largestVowelGroupSoFar
     largestVowelGroupSoFar= newVowelGroup
  #6 The first group is reported as the largest since we are not
